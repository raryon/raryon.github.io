	<h1>HTML Block elements</h1>
	<p>The basic layout of a web page built with HTML is to use blocks. The paragraph element is the most basic block element. When you use the html &lt;p> tag the following block will begin on a new line.
	
	When you press the enter key in your content, you will not create a new paragraph.  You must first end the current paragraph with the end paragraph tag and start the next paragraph with a new paragraph tag.</p>
	<p>When you begin a second paragraph with a new paragraph tag, there will be an extra blank line between the two paragraphs.<br>Another way to start your text on a new line is to add a br tag. The new content will start on a new line, but no extra blank line will appear before this content.</p>
	<h2>Heading elements</h2>
	<p>Use the h1 through h6 tag to add headings elements to your web page. The content will be bold and show various font sizes. The lower the number 1 - 6 the larger the font size. These are also block elements, therefore the content will begin on a new line.</p>
	<h2>List elements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Lists are contained inside of ul or ol tags.</li>
		<li>Unordered lists use the ul tag.</li>
		<li>Ordered lists use the ol tag.</li>
		<li>Each list item is contained in a li element.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>pre element</h2>
	<pre>
	Using the &lt;p> tag you cannot add extra spaces      using the space bar,
	only one space can be placed in the content using the space bar. 
	Also you cannot use the enter key or 	tab key as you would use in a word processor. The &lt;pre> tag preserves spaces, tabs and line breaks. 
	It also uses a fixed-width font.  
	Normally you would not use the pre tag. 
	To add extra space without the pre tag you can use the special entity (&nbsp;)
	</pre>
